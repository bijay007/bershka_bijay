    and live life by the day. Running after new challenges everyday while sweating and swearing is not worth.
    If there are too many challenges, then just face it with a smiley face. My favorite quote on this topic is
    "If life gives you lemons ...
    EAT THEM WHOLE.
    SERIOUSLY. 
    JUST CHOKE THEM ALL DOWN... SKIN, PULP, SEEDS, AND ALL AND DON’T BREAK EYE CONTACT. 
    MAYBE LIFE WILL STOP BEING SUCH AN ASSHOLE IF YOU SHOW IT THAT YOU’RE DONE FUCKING AROUND.

    eyes that you will be judged and critisized and loved and hated for every single action you do everyday
    for your whole life. My approach to this is just chill and not give a DUCKY duck. Try to look at you action from
    the perspective of what your younger self would think <insert your name> is correct and strive for your own progess.
    Try to be what you wanted to be as a small ambitious kid.
    DON'T COMPARE YOUR BEHIND THE SCENE WITH OTHERS HIGHLIGHTS

    will seem very less hostile and you will create a better small world for yourself and others.
    SMILE EVERYDAY
    LEARN EVERYDAY BECAUSE A MAN WILL ONLY BECOME WISE WHEN HE UNDERSTANDS THE EXTENT OF HIS IGNORANCE
